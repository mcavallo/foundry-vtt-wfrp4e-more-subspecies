## Source Data

You can find more information about each subspecies skills and talents in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SU834rU3BHtLv57bYg7TLZKWghYfZ5KHy2GjJ9fHbno/edit#gid=0).

This homebrew compilation was based on this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ehSmNG95dfgvZm1PxrzC5gCiPzBIbq2VwllN-APT3kc/edit#gid=0) that I found online and later refined to use in my groups. If you are the original author, please reach out so I can give you proper attribution for your work.

## Homebrew design choices

- All non-imperials are assumed to be proficient in their native language, but not in Reikspiel.
- Some subspecies have access to Lore skills relevant to local threats and neighboring provinces.
- Strigany are assumed to speak both Reikspiel and Strigany proficiently.
- Sylvanians are assumed to speak both Reikspiel and Sylvanian proficiently.
- Estalian, Tileans and Bretonnians have access to signature Melee/Ranged skills inspired by their army books.
- Kislevites have access to several physical talents to emphasize their heritage (GM discretion is advised)

# Installation / Usage

This module requires the [WFRP4E System](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/wfrp4e) and the [Core Module](https://cubicle7games.com/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-foundry-core-module).

1. Install the package following the [standard Foundry procedure](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/basics/Modules).
2. Go to the [module settings](https://github.com/mcavallo/foundry-vtt-wfrp4e-more-subspecies/wiki/Settings#enabled-datasets) and choose the subspecies you want to allow in your game.
3. Start a new character generation with the `/char` command to use the enabled subspecies.

**IMPORTANT:** The WFRP4E character generator requires either a GM to be present (from the very start of the process) or players to have the `Create New Actors` permission.
